# TEXTMYAGENT

> **Mission:** Let anyone talk to an AI assistant over iMessage (or any texting app backed by BlueBubbles) without opening a browser or installing a new app.

**Created by Weldon Makori.** Built with [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) iconography for consistent visuals across our docs.

TEXTMYAGENT turns everyday texting into an interface for a Claude-powered executive assistant. The service listens for inbound SMS/iMessage traffic through BlueBubbles, enriches conversations with long-term memory, and replies in real time while observing usage, rate limits, and context budgets.

### Why BlueBubbles-first matters

- 💬 **Native iMessage reach.** Users stay inside Messages with zero installs. Competitors typically rely on SMS short codes or clunky web chats that break continuity.
- 🧠 **Tight device integration.** BlueBubbles exposes delivery receipts, read states, attachments, and reactions—capabilities most “texting agents” can’t reliably access.
- 🛡️ **Owned infrastructure.** Everything funnels through your hardware, eliminating vendor lock-in and allowing strict credential control.

> **Other texting agents?** Most lean on brittle SMS gateways, lack live context memory, and force users into separate dashboards. TEXTMYAGENT lives where conversations already happen, keeps full histories, and ships with extensible tools. In short: they send blasts; we deliver a concierge.

## ✨ Why This Exists

People already live in their messaging apps. TEXTMYAGENT keeps the AI assistant there, so users can:

1. Text the agent from their phone or laptop using native Messages or any BlueBubbles-compatible client.
2. Get intelligent, context-aware responses powered by Anthropic Claude.
3. Capture reminders, summaries, and follow-ups without switching tools.

The platform is built for founders and operators who want a dependable AI teammate that fits existing communication workflows.

## 🧠 Core Feature Set

| Capability | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Text-based interface** | Two-way messaging over iMessage/SMS via BlueBubbles. |
| **Anthropic request manager** | Shared priority queue with rate limiting, backoff, and usage logging. |
| **Conversation memory** | Multi-layer memory (working/session/long-term) with automatic summarization to stay within token budgets. |
| **Tool execution** | Weather, reminders, email, calendar hooks, and easy extension points for more tools. |
| **Usage observability** | Structured logging, token accounting, and alerts when Anthropic quotas throttle traffic. |
| **Reminders & proactive outreach** | Natural language reminder parsing with reliable delivery through iMessage. |
| **Health monitoring** | Database/BlueBubbles readiness checks and graceful restarts. |

Key services inside `agent-service`:

- **MessageRouter** – cleans inbound messages, assembles context (with summarization), coordinates Claude calls, and dispatches replies.
- **ClaudeServiceEnhanced** – wraps Anthropic Claude with streaming, tool loops, and the centralized request manager.
- **AnthropicRequestManager** – enforces rate limits, retry/backoff, and notifies admins if API quotas are exhausted.
- **ConversationSummarizer** – compresses history when token usage approaches configurable thresholds.
- **NotificationService** – escalates critical events (e.g., repeated 429s) via iMessage to admin phones.
- **ReminderService** – natural language parsing + Bull queue to deliver proactive messages.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- macOS host with iMessage signed in (required by BlueBubbles).
- Node.js 18+.
- Docker Desktop (for Postgres & Redis in development).
- Anthropic API key with Claude 3 access.
- Running BlueBubbles server.

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ever-just/bluebubbles-ai-agent.git
cd bluebubbles-ai-agent/agent-service

npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Update `.env` with:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` – Claude credential.
- `BLUEBUBBLES_URL` and `BLUEBUBBLES_PASSWORD` – connection to your BlueBubbles instance.
- `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `SESSION_SECRET` – persistence and security settings.

Then start dependencies and the service:

```bash
docker-compose up -d postgres redis
npm run dev
# or npm run build && npm start for production mode
```

Successful startup shows logs confirming database, Redis, and BlueBubbles connections plus the Express server on port 3000.

## 📝 Usage Flow

1. **Inbound message** reaches BlueBubbles → forwarded to TEXTMYAGENT.
2. **MessageRouter** persists the user message, builds context (summary + recent tail), and requests a Claude completion.
3. **AnthropicRequestManager** schedules the request respecting concurrency/token quotas, adding retries on 429 responses.
4. **ClaudeServiceEnhanced** executes tool calls if needed, collapses tool responses back into the chat, and returns a final message capped by `ANTHROPIC_RESPONSE_MAX_TOKENS`.
5. **BlueBubblesClient** sends the reply over iMessage/SMS.
6. **Notifications** fire if requests exhaust retries or other critical errors occur.

## ⚙️ Configuration Highlights

Environment variables (see `.env.example` for defaults):

| Key | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Claude authentication |
| `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | Claude model (defaults to `claude-3-5-haiku-latest`) |
| `ANTHROPIC_ENABLE_WEB_SEARCH` | Enable Anthropic built-in web search tool (default `true`) |
| `ANTHROPIC_ENABLE_WEB_FETCH` | Enable Anthropic web fetch beta tool (default `false`) |
| `ANTHROPIC_RESPONSE_MAX_TOKENS` | Hard cap on response token budget to control costs |
| `ANTHROPIC_MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS` | Queue concurrency |
| `ANTHROPIC_SUMMARY_TRIGGER_TOKENS` | When to summarize conversation history |
| `BLUEBUBBLES_URL` / `BLUEBUBBLES_PASSWORD` | Messaging transport |
| `TYPING_INDICATORS_ENABLED` | Enable typing indicators (default `false` - disabled due to BlueBubbles timing issues) |
| `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL` | Persistence and job queue |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `SESSION_SECRET` | Secure storage and sessions |

## 📡 Features in Detail

### Conversation Intelligence
- **Automated summarization** keeps context manageable by trimming older turns and persisting a session memory snippet.
- **Token estimation & budgeting** guard against runaway Anthropic usage, especially on long chats.

### Reliability & Observability
- **Structured logging** with per-request metadata (tokens, queue length, retries) for debugging and cost tracking.
- **Admin alerts** sent via iMessage when Claude rate limits persist after retries.
- **Retry-after handling** respects Anthropic headers for smoother backoff.

### Extensibility
- Tool framework supports custom actions (e.g., CRM lookups, ticket creation).
- Reminder and notification pipelines can be extended to other channels (email, push) with minimal changes.

## 🗺️ Roadmap Ideas

- **Additional channels**: plug in WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack using similar transport bridges.
- **Knowledge retrieval**: vector search or RAG for richer answers.
- **User management**: multi-tenant controls, per-user memories, and billing hooks.
- **Analytics dashboard**: visualize usage, latency, and reminders in a web UI.
- **Automated tests**: expand integration coverage for BlueBubbles interactions.

## 📚 Supporting Docs

- `docs/guides/` – quick-starts, migrations, setup checklists, complexity breakdowns.
- `docs/operations/` – runbooks and deployment notes.

## 🔒 Security Practices

- `.env` is ignored by Git – keep API keys out of version control.
- Restrict database/Redis ports in production or use managed services.
- Rotate Claude and BlueBubbles credentials periodically.
- Enable rate limiting or auth for public-facing endpoints if exposing beyond trusted networks.
