# BlueBubbles AI Agent Research Plan

## Project Overview
Build a unified AI assistant accessible via iMessage (through BlueBubbles) and email, powered by Claude Agent SDK, with persistent context across all channels.

## Research Objectives

### Phase 1: Repository Analysis
1. **BlueBubbles Ecosystem Analysis**
   - [ ] Analyze BlueBubbles Server architecture
   - [ ] Analyze BlueBubbles Client implementations
   - [ ] Understand message flow and API structure
   - [ ] Identify integration points for AI agent
   - [ ] Document authentication mechanisms
   - [ ] Analyze webhook/event system

### Phase 2: Claude Agent SDK Research
2. **Claude Agent SDK Capabilities**
   - [ ] Review SDK documentation and features
   - [ ] Understand conversation management
   - [ ] Analyze context persistence options
   - [ ] Review tool/function calling capabilities
   - [ ] Understand rate limits and best practices

### Phase 3: Integration Architecture
3. **Multi-Channel Integration**
   - [ ] Design unified message router
   - [ ] Plan iMessage integration via BlueBubbles
   - [ ] Plan email integration (Google Workspace)
   - [ ] Design context synchronization system
   - [ ] Plan user identification across channels

### Phase 4: Feature Implementation Research
4. **Core Features**
   - [ ] Context persistence across channels
   - [ ] Proactive messaging (reminders, scheduled tasks)
   - [ ] Google Calendar integration via Auth0
   - [ ] Email inbox monitoring and response
   - [ ] Message queuing and delivery

### Phase 5: Technical Stack Selection
5. **Technology Decisions**
   - [ ] Backend framework selection
   - [ ] Database for context storage
   - [ ] Message queue system
   - [ ] Authentication/authorization approach
   - [ ] Deployment strategy

## Research Questions to Answer

### BlueBubbles Integration
1. How does BlueBubbles expose iMessage functionality?
2. What are the authentication requirements?
3. Can we receive real-time message notifications?
4. How do we send messages programmatically?
5. What are the rate limits or restrictions?

### Claude Agent SDK
1. How do we maintain conversation context?
2. Can we implement custom tools/functions?
3. How do we handle multi-turn conversations?
4. What's the best way to implement proactive messaging?
5. How do we manage rate limits?

### Email Integration
1. What's the best approach for Google Workspace integration?
2. Should we use IMAP/SMTP or Gmail API?
3. How do we monitor inbox in real-time?
4. How do we handle email threading?

### Context & State Management
1. How do we unify user identity across channels?
2. What database should store conversation history?
3. How do we sync context between channels?
4. What's the context window strategy?

### Proactive Features
1. How do we implement scheduled reminders?
2. What's the best job scheduling approach?
3. How do we handle timezone considerations?
4. How do we ensure delivery reliability?

## Next Steps
1. Clone and analyze BlueBubbles repositories
2. Review Claude Agent SDK documentation
3. Create detailed findings documents
